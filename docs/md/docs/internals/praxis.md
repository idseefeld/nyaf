## Practical Work

This section shows common scenarios and how to deal with them in all day projects.

### Component Inheritance

Often you have multiple very similar components. As components are classes, we can use the comon inheritance technique. The base class of a group of components can be either *.js* or *.ts* or even *.jsx* or *.tsx*. The *JSX* variant is only needed i f you wish to write template code internally and use this. For components with pure code go with standard  JavaScript/TypeScript classes.

Base component classes derive from `BaseComponent`. You must call the constructor and you must add the render method. If the base component does not render anything (the final component does), then just return `null` in the implementation. In case you use TypeScript, using the keyword `abstract` leads to a clean code structure.

The following example shows an abstract base component.

~~~ts
export abstract class DemoBaseComponent extends BaseComponent {

  constructor() {
    super();
  }

  abstract render(): Promise<string>;

  lifeCycle(lc: LifeCycle) {
    if (lc === LifeCycle.Render) {
      // Some action for all derived components
    }
  }

}
~~~

There is something remarkable here:

1. The component lacks the `@CustomElement` decorator. It's not required because the class will never create a component directly.
2. Also a registration is not necessary (and not possible), the inheritance is a pure language construct.
3. The `super` call **is** required and the *render* method **must** be written, either abstract or with an implementation.

You can also use any decorators on the base component, such as `@InjectService` on class level or `@Select` on property level. The class itself or the deriving class can also implement any of the helper interfaces, such as `IModel` or `IStore`.
